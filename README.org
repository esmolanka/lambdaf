Experiments with modular lambda calculus using datatypes Ã  la carte
and extensible effects

* Parts
  - ~Expr.hs~ -- bare lambda calculus (var, lam, app)
  - ~Prim/Base.hs~ -- base primitives and values (unit, pair, double)
  - ~Prim/Anf.hs~  -- primitives and values for ANF expressions of a residual program of a two-level language
  - ~Prim/Record.hs~ -- support of records (create, extend, select)
  - ~Prim/IO.hs~ -- support of IO (read line from stdin, write line to stdout)
  - ~Prim/Exception.hs~ -- support of exceptions (raise, catch)
  - ~Prim/Link.hs~ -- support of dynamically loading of expressions from other files

* MVP subtasks
  - [ ] Refactor evaluation, typechecking, side-effecting, and
    printing to even more modularised way
  - [ ] Type classes for numbers (and lifted numbers -- embedded or
    vectorised or embedded-vectorised)
  - [ ] Use subsumption checking and coercion for dynamically loaded
    expressions
  - [ ] Add variants and case expressions
  - [ ] Add lists and list paramorphisms for elimination
  - [ ] Add vectors and vector sublanguage (and the Nat kind?)
  - [ ] Make exceptions use variants
