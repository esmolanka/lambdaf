Experiments with modular lambda calculus using datatypes Ã  la carte and extensible effects

* `Expr.hs` -- bare lambda calculus (var, lam, app)
* `Base.hs` -- base primitives and values (unit, pair, double)
* `Anf.hs`  -- primitives and values for ANF expressions of a residual program of a two-level language
* `Record.hs` -- support of records (create, extend, select)
* `IO.hs`  -- support of reading from and writing to the console
